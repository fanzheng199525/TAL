# Tips for launching this chatbot
(Without step3 and step4, chatbot can't reply with the general answer)

## Step 1:

$git clone https://github.com/fanzheng199525/TAL.git

## Step 2:

$cd chatbot1.0

## Step 3:

Go to the google drive (url = https://drive.google.com/open?id=1i0ofe6_vbzmGePG2ymG_gwPDgm-FRB47) to download the folder “model” which have our training data. And replace the folder “model” in the folder chatbot1.0

## Step 4:

$pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Step 5:

$python3 main.py

By the way, if you fail with installing the requirements, just change the name mode33.py to mode3.py. It will work with a simple verison.
